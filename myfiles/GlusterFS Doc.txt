 # What is exactly glusterFS is .....?
 
 * Yeah.. Actually glusterFS is an open source file system.
 * It is used for storage for large scale files
 * And gllusterFS is also like NFS. it is different from standard file system so that really devolops and produces speed 
   of file recommandation
   and it get the very quickly and delivered for the applications or to our user
 * Yeah.moreover it advantages is any applications thats need access a file quickly and delivered it to user or our application
   and its faster than our relative file systems like NFS
  

 # Then coming to GlusterFS installation
 
 * We have install on glusterFS package on centos or ubuntu based on our requirement
 * Then we start our glusterFS application 
 * Again we have install glusterFS in all the nodes and including client machine
 * Then we have to group them. like we can open the created host file like vi /etc/hosts 
 * And then we can add our node ip address 
 * And its reapeted to remaining worker nodes and client machine also. these nodes are talk to each other.i mean it communicate 
   with each other
 * Then now we make sure need to they form single storage pool 
 * Then we check the glusterFS peer status


 # Replicated volume creation and volume mount

 * Then we make directory in worker nodes and then we create a volume for glusterFS volume create
 * Then we need to check the replicated volume is created or not... by using command of "gluster volume info" 
 * Then start and check the gluster volume status
 * Then create directory for mount a volume in client machine
 * then go to mount volume under this derectory.... by using command of " mount -t glusterFS <ourworkernode>:<volumename> 
   <clientmachinevolumedirectory> "
 * then we have to change directory to client machine volume directory 
 * For example to know our file is shared or not. testing purpose I Have a file creating this folder. automatically its created 
   file in all worker nodes
